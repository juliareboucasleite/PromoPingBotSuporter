# PromoPing Security Policy
### Reporting a Vulnerability
Security is a priority for PromoPing. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate you informing us responsibly.
Send a detailed email to **corporation.promoping@gmail.com** to report vulnerabilities in PromoPing. Even if you're not certain whether a bug is an exploitable vulnerability, we recommend sending the report to **corporation.promoping@gmail.com** and not discussing the issue elsewhere.
Discuss vulnerabilities only via email, and not publicly, until an official announcement on PromoPing's discussion list on the release date.

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide as much relevant information as possible to help us address the issue efficiently. Please describe the vulnerability in detail, including, if possible, a script or steps to reproduce or demonstrate the problem. Specify which platforms, systems, or scenarios are affected—sometimes vulnerabilities are limited to certain environments or configurations.

If you are part of a team or organization, or wish to be credited, include your name and affiliation. Let us know if the vulnerability has already been disclosed to anyone else, and if you recommend any embargo period prior to public disclosure to allow time for users to update or mitigate safely.

Once we receive your report, we will confirm receipt within 48 hours, provide an initial assessment within 7 days, keep you updated on the progress of the fix, and offer public acknowledgment (if you wish) after the vulnerability is resolved.

## Supported Versions
There are no official "Long-term Support" versions in PromoPing. Fixes are made to the maintenance branch of the most recent feature version (also known as ".0" version) and receive occasional updates with bug fixes.
Vulnerability fixes are made to the maintenance branch of the most recent feature version and merged into development branches. The PromoPing project does not offer a formal guarantee that older maintenance branches will receive updates, but in practice, critical vulnerability fixes are applied not only to the most recent branch, but to at least one or two older maintenance tracks.
This is normally done by applying the fix to the oldest still relevant maintenance branch and merging it upwards to newer and more recent maintenance tracks.
