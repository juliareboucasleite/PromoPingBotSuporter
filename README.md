# PromoPing Bot Suporter

> **Note:** This is the administrative Discord bot of the PromoPing ecosystem, developed in Java using JDA (Java Discord API).

PromoPing Bot Suporter is the administrative component of the PromoPing system, a price monitoring system focused on the Portuguese market. This bot provides administrative and support functionalities through Discord, allowing you to manage and monitor the PromoPing system directly from the Discord server.

PromoPing allows users to track products across various online shops and receive automatic notifications when prices reach defined targets. The administrative bot facilitates the management and support of this system through Discord commands.

> **Note:** PromoPing monitors products chosen by the user and does not compare prices between shops.

## Architecture

PromoPing Bot Suporter is developed using Java 11 or higher as the main programming language. It utilizes the JDA (Java Discord API) library for integrating with Discord, and dependency management is handled through either Maven or Gradle.

## Security

The bot applies several layers of security protection. It validates permissions for all administrative commands and sanitizes command input to prevent misuse. Structured logging and complete auditing are implemented to ensure transparency and accountability. The system protects all tokens and sensitive credentials, and incorporates robust exception handling to minimize security risks.
