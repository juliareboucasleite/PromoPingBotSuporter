# PromoPing Code of Conduct
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in the PromoPing project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

**Behaviour that Contributes to a Positive Environment**: Using welcoming and inclusive language, being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, gracefully accepting constructive criticism, focusing on what is best for the community, showing empathy towards other community members.

**Unacceptable Behaviour**: The use of sexualised language or imagery, insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks, public or private harassment, publishing others' private information without permission, other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour. Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
